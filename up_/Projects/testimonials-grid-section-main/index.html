I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. </h2> <p> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p> </div> <div class="flex-container grid-item"> <div class="flex-item"> <img src="image-jonathan.693fb75e.jpg" alt=""> <div class="name"> <div class="flex-name"> <p>Jonathan Walters</p> <p>Verified Graduate</p> </div> </div> </div> <h2>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2> <p> “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.

Highly recommended!</h2> <p> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ” </p> </div> </body></html>
